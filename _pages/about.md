I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University, where I'm hosted by [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/vzikas/). Most of my research is focused on the design and analysis of secure muti-party computation (MPC) protocols - where the goal is to compute on distributed data in a privacy preserving manner. 

I received my PhD from Oregon State University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mike Rosulek](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/). My graduate research at OSU was focused on studying applications and constructions for homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) and new extensions of function secret sharing (FSS), which are useful building blocks for other cryptographic protocols and applications. 

Before joining OSU, I graduated with an M.S in Computer Science from Yale University and a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India. At IIT Ropar my undergrad research was advised by Sudarshan Iyengar.
