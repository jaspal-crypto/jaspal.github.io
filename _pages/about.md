I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University, where I'm hosted by [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/vzikas/). Most of my research is focused on the design and analysis of secure muti-party computation (MPC) protocols - where the goal is to compute on distributed data in a privacy preserving manner. 

I received my PhD from Oregon State University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mike Rosulek](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/). My graduate research at OSU was focused on studying applications and constructions for homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) and new extensions of function secret sharing (FSS), which are useful building blocks for other cryptographic protocols and applications. 

Before joining OSU, I graduated with an M.S in Computer Science from Yale University and a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, India. At IIT Ropar my undergrad research was advised by Sudarshan Iyengar.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
